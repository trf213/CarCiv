                                <h2 class="tm-section-title">Culture</h2>
                                <p class="tm-section-description">Throughout previous years and years to come, the Caribbean was known to be made up of a variety of societies who each have their own different cultures. As a result of man settling years ago, civilizations were formed, which further led to the derivation of these cultures. For some, it is seen as a great unifying factor as it defines and connects groups of people who share similar values, practices and life styles that have been passed down and practiced through generation to generation.  Each culture is unique and differentiates a specific group from the entire world. However, though some are very proud of their cultural identity, it can also be a divisive force which has unfortunately led to the intolerance of culture and having mistrust. Evidence of these two behaviours were displayed during previous times when colonialists oppressed slaves but is still very much apparent even today’s society throughout the Caribbean. For example, in previous years, the Spanish possessed an ethnocentric mentality when it came to the way of life for the neo – Indians. They viewed their own culture and way of life as superior and deemed the neo – Indian’s as inferior. Along with this, the male Europeans also had an androcentric mentality and highly sexualized and showed no respect towards the indigenous women. There was a vast difference between the basic attire of the Spanish and the Neo-Indian’s attire. While the European women were fully clothed, the neo Indian women used less clothing. The Neo-Indians culture was predominantly judged and entirely disregarded. The male Spaniards believed that their lack of clothing somehow signified promiscuity and this influenced how they interacted with them. This kind of mentality till lurks throughout the Caribbean as it relates to how a fraction of Caribbean males interact with females on a daily basis. A quote from Patrice M. Daniel in an article entitled “An Open Letter to Caribbean Men, From Caribbean Women” says “ We do not dress for you. Our bodies are our own. The length of a skirt is not a personal message to you. Cleavage is not an invitation. Like most shoes, ours can’t speak. So our heels don’t say, “Do me.” Our legs are not dinner bells, loudly chiming, “Come and get it!” You don’t get to say our bare skin provoked you. You don’t get to say you lost control. Take responsibility for your behavior, just as we take responsibility for ours. And stop, Caribbean men. Stop using our clothes as an excuse when you rape or violate us. We do not dress for you. Our bodies are our own.” This short extract expresses how this basic mentality that our female ancestors fell victim to still lingers throughout our societies within the Caribbean.”  From the extract alone this author expresses her annoyance for how men approach females within the Caribbean. In Barbados for example, it is very common for a female to be walking down the street and being attacked with provocative and sexual comments from men who demand to be noticed.</p>

                            <h2 class="tm-section-title">Cultural expression</h2>
                            <p class="tm-section-description">Caribbean culture and expression are transmissible and are always evolving. Caribbean culture can be viewed as a body of learned behaviors that is often seen in the Caribbean region and is passed from generation to generation. In today’s society there is somewhat a struggle of ideology of what Caribbean expression. The argument of “Pure versus Diluted Forms of Culture” is one that shows the mistrust and ignorance between the older generation and the younger generation coming up today, with the younger generation being ignorant to the true meaning of carnival and the older generation mistrust in having the younger generation carry on the legacy. Bilby states he agrees with Brathwaite where carnival was once a celebration of survival through slavery times, and a highly spiritual celebration is no longer that but has become “fundamentally secular” (Bilby 2010). Furthermore one has personally observed that carnival in today’s society is mainly a ploy to allow governments to maximize profits during festival session, Bilby also stated this by stating that even though the costumes vibrancy is said to represent aspect of culture it is evidently secular and the degree of commodification is closely like to tourism. In additions Nurse states in his findings that “Festival tourism in the Caribbean makes an important contribution to the wider economy in that it increases government tax receipts, generates employment and sectoral linkages, attracts business sponsorship & cross promotions and has a spillover effect on ancillary sectors like the media and advertising industries, auto rentals and restaurants.” (Nurse n.d.).However though this is the case Nurse also states that successful festivals build the society’s cultural confidence and image of self-worth and identity.
                                Calypso was created to bring social issues to life, however Calypso is now known as soca. Here is where the mistrust occurs soca pioneers are trying to have soca more than just a national or regional appreciated genre and be globally recognized. However These days, the current soca genre is so broad, it incorporates pop, techno, R&B and afro beat, but no matter how coalescent it becomes, it’s always underpinned by that unmistakable rum-soaked, decadence of the party-loving waist-wining Caribbean island (Surtees 2015). Calypso has moved so far from the original sound and meaning has made it undistinguishable to some extent as an independent genre.This lead to the mistrust toward newer soca artist from older artist toward newer artist.

                            <h2 class="tm-section-title">Colorism</h2>
                            <p class="tm-section-description">Colorism is a social theory defined in conjunction with shadeism as the prejudice or discrimination against individuals with a darker skin tone typically among people of the same ethnic or racial group. (Rhodes)
                                Colorism in this context, is considered a social disease and is believed to be a result of colonialism. Colonization was usually carried out by individuals of the Caucasian ethnic background and it was often over African or Amerindian people indigenous to the country. The Caribbean island, Barbados, was colonized in 1627 by the British who were typically Caucasian (white) and they brought African slaves with them to inhabit the island. The indigenous people of Barbados were Amerindians, and those along with the African slaves were governed by the British. 
                                The White slave owners were extremely strict and authoritative over their plantations, hence the slaves were restricted and limited in their activities outside of working on the plantations. In some instances, the slave owners were sexually involved with their slaves and in so doing produced a mixed breed of persons. They were called derogatory names such as Red Leg, Eckey Becky, Red Necks, Poor Backra etc. 
                                This altered the social structure where the white elite was at the top of the social ladder, the dark skin African slaves were at the bottom and in between these two groups of persons were slaves known as the Freedmen.  They represented a new class in Barbados that were neither considered black nor white with the majority of them having a lighter skin tone.  Privileges enjoyed by this group of persons were severely limited in relation to whites. (Lindsey)  One such privilege was that even though they were not claimed as blood family, they were not viewed the same as the darker slaves. The belief that the lighter your complexion, the higher up you were on the social hierarchy has affected the way in which people treat each other and themselves. We have come a long way in Barbados since Independence in 1966, however, “The slave trade has altered many norms of ethnic groups who have been exposed to it” (Valle) Beckles lends to this claim by saying “The effects of slavery and colonialism are like a miasma all around choking us”. (Beckles) 
                                The stigma associated with person of a dark complexion has led many to drastic changes towards their outward appearances. “Black women in Barbados applied chemicals their hair to straighten it and chemicals in the form of bleaching creams to whiten their bodies.” (Lindsey), this bleaching craze is quite evident in Barbados as there is an upsurge in the purchasing of bleaching products. In the NationNews newspaper article dated 23 April, 2011, entitled “The bleaching Phenomena”, “Some Barbadians have been brainwashed into the belief that the lighter there are in complexion the better and more beautiful they will be.” (Carol Martindale) .
                                “The ‘peculiar institution’, as slavery has been termed, has left many psychological scars on both the colored and non- colored population afflicted with the disease. Family structure, attitudes towards work, male-female relationships etc. are all traced to the days of slavery.” (Lindsey) This contributed to a culture of mistrust.  Slaves were in great demand and were obtained by any means necessary e.g the raiding of villages. Nunn and Wantchekon found that individuals whose ancestors were heavily raided are less trusting of others. (Valle) Betrayal of own family members tricking and selling each into slavery also contributed to culture of mistrust. 
                                Intolerance is a lack of respect for practices or beliefs other than ones’own.it also involves the rejection of people whom we perceive as different. (Council of Europe) Types of intolerance includes racism, “Racism involves discriminatory or abusive behaviours of intolerance where discriminatory behaviours towards people of their imagined ‘inferiority’”. (Council of Europe)Barbadian discriminated against Guyanese and in recent times Haitians. Accusing them of coming to take away all the jobs on the Barbadian market, purporting that their own was more qualified.  Religious intolerance.  the constitution of Barbados provides for the freedom of religion however for years rastafarians fought for permission to use marijuana as it is used in their rituals.  In addition, vaccinations required by law for school entry is also against their religion. Muslims women in Barbados are required to remove coverings when being photographed for passports and identification cards.

                            <p class="tm-section-description">Feminism is a well-known form of tolerance in the Caribbean today the way women are treated in comparison to men in the working society.  Times now may seem different, but today as a society we still reflect on some aspects of our past as it pertains to gender evaluation.  In historical times women were seen to be more fitted for field work compared to the men but was always excluded from doing the more physically skilled jobs such as carpentry or masonry.   Women today still go through these types of exclusions in some parts of the Caribbean because of the mistrust shown by company owners and managers when they are trying find jobs or looking to fill a specific position.  Most times in these situations they may be just as qualified or even more qualified for the position than the men, but they are then rejected because of the historical background that has been put into place.  The African slave woman as a worker was always compared to the European ideal of the woman as housewife. The notion of the woman as worker was also true under the system of indentureship. Race and cultural identities also played a role in this for women if they were a certain shade or looked a certain way.  We find that white women are more likely to be put on the pedestal since they were always perceived as belonging to the oppressor race and culture.  The result of this as stated by Baksh-Soodeen “race/ethnicity became the key platform for exposing differences in women's lived experiences of subordination, resulting in feminists defining themselves as 'black', 'native American', 'Asian', 'women of colour' and so on.”  In recent years there has been a unique gender-training programme which was designed to develop a small group of women and men in the region trained in gender analysis, with a basic understanding of the feminist theories and who could recognise the connections between gender analysis and policy development.  The programme introduced participants to feminist theoretical and methodological approaches of how unequal power relations between men and women are manifested ideologically and materially in fostering gender inequality that hampers socio-economic progress in the region. It has been stated that Caribbean feminism has been characterised by its distinction from North American and European feminism which they saw as polarising men and women.  “The work of the early feminists of the Anglophone Caribbean… these were middle class women who were actively conscious of their African/Indian heritage at a time of great European colonial power and control. Their relationship to women of the working classes ranged from solidarity to charity.” (Reddock)
